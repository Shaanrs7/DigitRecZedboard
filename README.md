# Digit Recognition System using K-nearest neighbors on Zynq SoC FPGA 
Handwritten digit recognition system which compares the handwritten digit to an idealized training set and determines the digit written. Project includes training sets, sample inputs (180 test cases) and tcl files to generate Verilog RTL from HLS for baseline, loop unrolled and pipelined designs.
Pre-generated bitstreams included.
Code in Vivado HLS C++.
